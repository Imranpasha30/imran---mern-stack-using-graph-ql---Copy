# graphql package =>
GraphQL is a query language and runtime for executing queries against your application's data graph. It enables clients to request only the data they need, which can lead to more efficient and flexible API interactions.

# @graphql-tools/merge:=>
This package is part of the GraphQL Tools library, which provides utilities for building and manipulating GraphQL schemas. @graphql-tools/merge specifically allows you to merge multiple GraphQL schemas into a single schema, which can be useful for modularizing your schema definitions.

# @apollo/server =>
Apollo Server is a GraphQL server implementation designed to work seamlessly with the Apollo client. It provides features like schema stitching, caching, and subscriptions, making it easy to build powerful GraphQL APIs.

# typedefs (short for type definitions)
 are used to define the structure and types of data that can be queried or manipulated through the GraphQL API. Type definitions are a fundamental part of the GraphQL schema, which serves as a contract between the client and the server.

 # resolvers => 
Resolvers are functions responsible for fetching the data for a specific field in the GraphQL schema. Each field in the schema can have an associated resolver function. Resolvers are typically implemented as part of a resolver map, which maps field names to resolver functions.
